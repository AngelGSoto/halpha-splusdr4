** Main sequence stars
I putted the track of unredened MS and giant stars from [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998PASP..110..863P/abstract][Pickles et al.]] in the color-color diagram .

** Getting and cleaning the data

The data were downloaded from the [[https://splus.cloud/][SPLUS.CLOUD]], and a preliminary cut were in the [[programs/getting-splusdata-basedGustavo.py][query]] 
using Python to cleaned the data. And after I apply some criteria to getting data with very high quality,
this after to make different tests.

*Additionally criteria to cleaned the data*

 The criteria are systematically chosen to ensure the robustness and 
reliability of the selected sample, taking into account various photometric 
and morphological properties of the sources.

1. **Photometric Properties**:
   - We apply stringent constraints on the photometric 
properties of the sources to ensure that we focus on objects 
with appropriate brightness levels for detecting Hα emission. 
Specifically, we select sources with magnitudes in the r, J0660, 
and i bands falling within defined ranges (r_PStotal > 16 and r_PStotal ≤ 17.5, J0660_PStotal ≤ 19.4, i_PStotal ≤ 19.2).

2. **Error Values**:
   - To ensure the reliability of our measurements, 
we impose upper limits on the error values associated with the photometric measurements. 
Sources with error values exceeding 0.2 in any of the photometric bands are excluded from the analysis.

3. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**:
   - We require sources to have a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in each photometric band to 
ensure sufficient signal strength relative to the noise. Sources with SNR values below 10 are considered 
to have insufficient signal and are excluded from further analysis.

4. **Ellipticity**:
   - We consider the morphological properties of the sources by imposing a threshold on ellipticity. 
Sources with ellipticity values greater than 0.2 are likely to have non-galactic or irregular shapes 
and are therefore excluded from consideration.

5. **Flux Radius**:
   - We select sources with compact morphology by constraining the radius enclosing 50% of the total flux. 
Sources with a flux radius exceeding 3 pixels are likely to have extended morphology and are thus excluded from the sample.

Each of these criteria is chosen based on considerations of the characteristics of our dataset, the sensitivity of our observations, 
and the requirements for detecting Hα emission. By applying these stringent selection criteria, we aim to ensure the reliability and 
robustness of the identified sample of Hα emitters.

All thse yield the follow stars:

- 13 < r < 16 => 1027290
- 16 < r 17.5 => 1676988
- 17.5 < r < 18.5 => 1733486
- 18.5 < r < 19.5 = > 2217375

** Choose the better selection criteria

   I have implemented variance estimation methods proposed by Monguio and Fratta, and I have
   proposed an alternative method that yields better estimates to search for a better selection
   of Halpha emitters. The results are even better when applying the algorithm per field.
   The implementation of my approach can be found in this [[programs/Selecting_Halpha_objects_PerField.py][Python Script]].
   

*Justification for Variance Estimation Formula in Selecting H\alpha Emitters*

In our study, we employed a rigorous approach to identify H$\alpha$ emitters in astronomical datasets, 
aiming to robustly isolate objects exhibiting H$\alpha$ emission features. Central to this process is 
the determination of a reliable criterion that effectively distinguishes genuine H$\alpha$ emitters 
from other sources of noise and contamination.

The selection criterion we adopted involves the computation of a threshold value based on the observed 
colors $(r - i)$ and $(r - J0660)$, where $(r - i)$ represents the difference between the magnitudes 
measured in the $r$ and $i$ filters, and $(r - J0660)$ represents the difference between the magnitudes 
in the $r$ filter and the H$\alpha$ filter (J0660).

To quantify the uncertainty associated with these color measurements and ensure a robust selection 
criterion, we derived a variance estimation formula denoted as \texttt{variance\_est}. 
This formula incorporates several key components:

\begin{equation}
\texttt{variance\_est} = \sigma_{\text{fit}}^2 + m^2 \cdot (\text{e}(r - i))^2 + (1 - m)^2 \cdot (\text{e}(r - J0660))^2
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Sigma Fit ($\sigma_{\text{fit}}$)}: This term accounts for the intrinsic scatter in the fitted linear model, 
representing the variability observed around the best-fit line. It captures the dispersion of data points from the regression 
line, providing an indication of the overall uncertainty in the model fit.

\item \textbf{Slope of the Fitted Line ($m$)}: The slope of the fitted line characterizes the relationship between the 
colors $(r - i)$ and $(r - J0660)$. It reflects the degree of correlation between these color indices and influences the 
selection criterion's sensitivity to deviations from the fitted model.

\item \textbf{Errors in Color Measurements}: The terms $\text{e}(r - i)$ and $\text{e}(r - J0660)$ represent the 
errors associated with the color measurements $(r - i)$ and $(r - J0660)$, respectively. These errors encapsulate uncertainties arising 
from observational noise, instrumental effects, and intrinsic variations in source fluxes.
\end{itemize}

By combining these components, the variance estimation formula \texttt{variance\_est} provides a comprehensive assessment 
of the overall uncertainty in the color measurements $(r - i)$ and $(r - J0660)$. It accounts for both the intrinsic 
scatter in the data and the precision of the individual color measurements, enabling a robust determination of the 
selection criterion.

We selected this variance estimation formula based on its ability to incorporate the full range of uncertainties 
associated with the color indices, thereby ensuring a stringent and reliable criterion for identifying H$\alpha$
emitters. By considering the intrinsic scatter in the data and the errors in color measurements, we aimed to minimize the 
impact of noise and artifacts, facilitating the accurate identification of genuine H$\alpha$ emission features.

*** Comparison of Approaches for Selecting Halpha Emitters

In this section, we compare two different approaches for 
selecting Halpha emitters based on color criteria.
 Both approaches involve estimating the variance in color 
measurements and identifying objects with color deviations 
indicative of Halpha emission. We will discuss each approach and highlight their differences.

*** Fratta et al. Approach:

Fratta et al. proposed an approach to select H\alpha emitters 
based on color criteria. Their method involves estimating the 
variance in color measurements and identifying objects with 
significant deviations from the fitted model. The variance estimation 
formula used by Fratta et al. is given by:

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\[ \text{variance\_est} = \sigma_{\text{rms}}^2 + \text{error}^2(r - \text{Hα}) + m_{\text{fit}}^2 \cdot \text{error}^2(r - i) \]
#+END_LaTeX

In this formula, \( \sigma_{\text{rms}}^2 \) represents the intrinsic scatter, \( \text{error}(r - \text{Hα}) \) is 
the error in the Halpha color measurement, and \( m_{\text{fit}}^2 \cdot \text{error}^2(r - i) \) accounts for 
deviations in the reference color \( r - i \) influenced by the slope of the fitted line \( m_{\text{fit}} \).

*** Recommended Approach:

Alternatively, we propose a slightly different approach for selecting Halpha emitters. Our method 
also involves estimating the variance in color measurements and identifying objects with significant 
deviations from the fitted model. The variance estimation formula used in our approach is as follows:

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\[ \text{variance\_est} = \sigma_{\text{fit}}^2 + m^2 \cdot \text{error}^2(r - i) + (1 - m)^2 \cdot \text{error}^2(r - \text{Hα}) \]
#+END_LaTeX

In this formula, \( \sigma_{\text{fit}}^2 \) represents the intrinsic scatter, \( \text{error}(r - i) \) is the error in the \( r - i \) 
color measurement, and \( (1 - m)^2 \cdot \text{error}^2(r - \text{Hα}) \) accounts for deviations in the Halpha color influenced 
by the slope of the fitted line \( m \).

*** Comparison:

The main difference between the two approaches lies in the treatment of the slope of the fitted line \( m \) or \( m_{\text{fit}} \). 
In the Fratta et al. approach, the squared slope term \( m_{\text{fit}}^2 \) only affects the error in the reference color \( r - i \), 
potentially emphasizing its influence over deviations in \( r - \text{Hα} \). On the other hand, in our recommended approach, the slope \( m \) 
affects both terms in the variance estimation formula, providing a balanced consideration of its impact on color deviations.

Ultimately, the choice between the two approaches depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired sensitivity to 
deviations from the fitted model.

*Justification for Applying the Algorithm per Field*

Applying the algorithm per field can be the better choice for the following reasons:

1. **Field-specific characteristics:** Different fields may exhibit unique characteristics
   such as varying levels of background noise, instrumental effects, or sky conditions.
   By analyzing each field separately, we can tailor the algorithm to account for
   these differences, leading to more accurate results.

2. **Minimizing contamination:** Some fields may have higher levels of contamination
   from non-Halpha sources, such as stars or galaxies with similar colors.
   By analyzing each field independently, we can better identify and filter
   out such contaminants, resulting in a cleaner sample of Halpha emitters.

3. **Optimizing parameters:** Certain parameters of the algorithm may need to
   be adjusted depending on the characteristics of each field. By running the
   algorithm separately for each field, we can optimize these parameters to
   maximize the detection of true Halpha emitters while minimizing false positives.

4. **Enhancing statistical robustness:** Analyzing each field independently allows
   for better statistical assessment of the results within that specific context.
   It reduces the risk of biases introduced by averaging over diverse data and enhances
   the robustness of the findings.

5. **Facilitating interpretation:** By presenting results on a per-field basis, it becomes
   easier to interpret and compare the properties of Halpha emitters across different regions
   of the sky. This approach can provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution
   and environmental factors influencing Halpha emission in different astronomical contexts.

Overall, applying the algorithm per field enables a more tailored and accurate analysis,
leading to better characterization and understanding of Halpha emitters in each specific region of interest.

** Results

   *** Why EB and RRlyra stars a high latitude?

   he identification of more eclipsing binaries and RR Lyrae stars at higher latitudes could be attributed to several physical factors:

    Galactic Halo: At higher latitudes, you may be probing regions outside the main disk of the galaxy, such as the galactic halo.
    The galactic halo contains older stellar populations, including RR Lyrae stars, which are commonly found in globular clusters a
    nd halo substructures. These stars are relatively faint and can be more easily detected against the darker background of the
    halo compared to the crowded regions of the galactic disk.

    Stellar Populations: The distribution of different stellar populations can vary with galactic latitude.
    In the disk, you may predominantly detect younger stellar populations associated with ongoing star formation. As you move
    to higher latitudes, the prevalence of older stellar populations, including those containing RR Lyrae stars, may increase.
    Eclipsing binaries, which are systems consisting of two stars orbiting around their common center of mass and periodically
    eclipsing each other, can also be more prevalent in older stellar populations.

    Survey Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the survey instruments and techniques may play a role in the detection of different
    types of objects. For example, RR Lyrae stars are relatively faint and may require deeper observations or specialized
    detection methods to be identified. High-latitude observations may benefit from reduced contamination and background noise,
    allowing for more sensitive detection of faint objects such as eclipsing binaries and RR Lyrae stars.

    Differential Extinction: Extinction due to interstellar dust can affect the observed colors and magnitudes of stars,
    particularly in the galactic plane where dust concentrations are higher. At higher latitudes, where dust extinction may
    be lower, the observed colors of stars can be less affected by dust reddening, making it easier to identify specific
    types of stars based on their intrinsic properties.

By considering these factors, astronomers can better understand the distribution and properties of different types of
stars across the sky and gain insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies like the Milky Way.
